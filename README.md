Data Struct repo

something notice and convention:
* `.h` file contains function implementation for convenience
* assume all number which maybe use is int type
* use CLion 2020.2.3 compile
* compile standard is `c99`

Coding style:
* use CLion to format code indent
* use lower camel case to name function
* use lower case and underline to name struct
* use Upper camel case to name variable defined by `typedef`
* function name with `__` denote is private function(for expect) 
* function name with `_` will carry some addition information, like `mergeSort_2` denote it is 2 road merge sort
